# Lame_Dog_Leg_ML_Prediction

### Task description:
The Cornell Vet School wants to predict whether a dog's leg is lame (or limp) based on the numerical results of a method called Force Plate Gait Analysis. We are given features X of several dogs and we want to predict, for each leg (right-front, left-front, right-hind, left-hind), whether that leg is normal or lame. Thus, we want to make 4 different predictions y_RF, y_LF, y_RH, y_LH.
